Just stepped out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness. And oh boy, what was THAT about? I mean, really. I'm kinda tired, maybe slightly irritated? But still hooked on that madness. Seriously, whoever pitched that   was clearly riding on a wave of some cosmic inspiration or just had their head in the clouds.

The whole time I was sitting there, I felt it — like someone kept poking me with a stick between boredom and oh no, I'm actually crying. You know how a cat does that thing where it puffs up for literally no reason? Yeah. That's me after this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. 

> Like, why did they focus on that glowing lamp for 20 minutes as if it had the secrets of the universe? Which, maybe it did. Maybe that lamp was a metaphor, or was it just to mess with my head? And you know you've thought too hard about a   when you're questioning the significance of household items.

The characters, oh they're something alright. It's like they walked off a cheesy soap opera set and jumped right into an art 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. One moment I'm laughing at their overly dramatic sighs, next I'm feeling for them as if they've been my neighbors for years. What kind of director does that? And can we talk about the soundtrack? Was it birds chirping or just odd flute noises? You ever experience that weird tingle in your elbows when you're feeling unsure about life choices? That was me during the whole forest scene. Just... tingling elbows and existential crises. 

I swear one of the lines made me think of my grandma’s ancient cookie recipe, nostalgic yet slightly burnt at the edges. Don't ask me why, it just did. Maybe I’ll have to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and pause that part, try to decipher the weird maze of emotions.

Oh and before I forget, here's some random nonsense that popped into my head during the middle of Act 2:

```cpp
if (love == true) {
   darkness = false;
}
```

Makes absolutely no sense, right? Welcome to the chaos that is my mind post- .

Anyway, if you’re up for an emotional rollercoaster, give it a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. Just beware of glowing lamps and unexpected elbow tingles. Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again? Maybe in a few light-years. But hey, never know when you'll need a good laugh or a continuous 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 of “what the hell?!” moments.
